    <h2>Core Skills</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am a Senior Azure DevOps Engineer and Cloud Application Developer with deep expertise in data engineering, cloud-native application development, and infrastructure automation. My experience spans across the banking domain and enterprise transformation projects, where I‚Äôve delivered scalable, reliable, and innovative solutions on the Microsoft Azure platform.

In my current role, I lead a Data Engineering team, focusing on end-to-end automation of data ingestion into Azure Data Lake. I design and optimize data pipelines using Azure Data Factory, Databricks (PySpark), Python, SQL, and YAML-based CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps, ensuring seamless deployment, scalability, and high performance. I also leverage Apache Airflow and other Azure services to automate workflows and guarantee reliability.

Alongside my data engineering responsibilities, I am an experienced developer in cloud application and API development on the .NET stack. I design, develop, and deploy cloud-native applications using ASP.NET Core (2.1, 3.1), ASP.NET Framework (4.5, 4.7), microservices, MVC, and WebForms, while continuously innovating through application R&D. I have strong experience in C#, RDBMS and NoSQL databases, and a proven track record of integrating applications seamlessly into Azure ecosystems.

My expertise extends across a wide range of Azure services, including App Services, Logic Apps, Functions, Web Apps, Virtual Machines, Managed Identities, Storage Accounts, VNets, Azure AD, SQL Databases, Load Balancers, and Key Vault. I also have solid knowledge of backup and retention architectures within Azure, ensuring secure and resilient cloud solutions.

Passionate about building future-ready systems, I thrive in Agile environments, collaborating with stakeholders and clients to align solutions with business goals. My work has also taken me onsite to Utrecht, Netherlands, where I partnered closely with clients to drive transformation and strengthen delivery outcomes.

I‚Äôm committed to creating solutions that not only solve today‚Äôs challenges but also future-proof infrastructure and applications for long-term success.</li>
